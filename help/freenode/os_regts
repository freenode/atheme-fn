Help for REGTS:

The REGTS command adjusts the registration timestamp on an
existing registration at runtime.

The timestamp is given as a UNIX timestamp in seconds since
the epoch.

Nickname registrations are automatically adjusted to be no
older than their owning account registration if the latter
is changed.

Syntax: REGTS <USER|NICK|CHANNEL> <target> <timestamp>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& REGTS USER foo 1319240631
    /msg &nick& REGTS NICK foo-test 1400000000
    /msg &nick& REGTS CHANNEL #help 759808142
