Help for CONTACT:

The CONTACT command allows to maintain the list of a project's
registered group contacts. Group contacts can gain full access
to any channel within their project's namespaces.

Group contacts are added as primary, non-public contacts by default.
The PUBLIC flag will list group contacts in the ChanServ INFO command;
the SECONDARY flag serves informational purposes and is only shown
to network staff and the contact themselves.

Syntax: CONTACT <project> ADD <account> [PUBLIC|PRIVATE] [PRIMARY|SECONDARY]
Syntax: CONTACT <project> SET <account> [PUBLIC|PRIVATE] [PRIMARY|SECONDARY]
Syntax: CONTACT <project> DEL <account>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& CONTACT CoolProject ADD NewMaintainer PUBLIC
    /msg &nick& CONTACT CoolProject SET OldMaint PRIVATE SECONDARY
    /msg &nick& CONTACT CoolProject DEL RetiredGC
